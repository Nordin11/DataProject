#### Mon 8 - Wed 10 January:
- Finished deadlines concerning the dates

#### Thu 11 January:
- Finished Data Gathering
- Getting html template "D3 ready"
- Finished main website layout via bootstrap 

#### Mon 15 January: 
- Add process book to GitHub
- Loading price_history data
- Adding price charts
- Had some troubles in reforming the date in to a proper format  

#### Tue 16 January: 
- Start first in the morning with the correlation matrix
- Had some version issues
- Converted everything to Version 3 
- Finished the first correlation visualization  

#### Wed 17 January: 
- Worked on style guide 
- Didn't code this day because I had to think about how to transform the correlation data in to a proper JSON format so that I can work on it for the network graph.

#### Thu 18 January:
- Write and test the algorithm that transforms the data in to a good network format
- Wrote the algorithm for the transformation of the JSON Data in python.
- Also thought about transforming the price history data, I want the data to be normalized instead of the adjusted close price. This gives a lot more meaning to the line chart. 
- Transformed the price history data in to normalized data in python.

#### Mon 22 January:
- Worked on interactions of the correlation matrix
- such as te color mapping and hover interactions
- have some difficulties in hiding and showing the correlation matrix when clicking on the dropdown items
- added GitHub pages to project, but doesn't seem to load jQuery, will try to fix this tomorrow. 

#### Tue 23 January:
- Finished the interaction with the dropdown menu and correlation matrix
- Spent the whole day on the network graph. I did finish the main network. But there are too many links in matrix, so I have to filter the data later. 
- Somehow GitHub pages still doesn't load jQuery. So the dropdown doesn't work in GitHub pages.. 

#### Wed 24 January: 
- Fixed the GitHub pages problem
- Made the interaction between the correlation matrix and the price charts. 
- started with a new idea on the networking graph. I am going to make a slider that triggers the bound in from which correlation strength the user wants to see the lines between the nodes in the graph.

#### Thu 25 January:
- Finished the interactions with the network graph and added the slider, this went through a lot of debugging
- Changed the price data again. I normalized it so by indexing the first date.
